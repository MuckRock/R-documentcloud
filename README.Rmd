# rdocumentcloud

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of rdocumentcloud is to serve as an R wrapper for the DocumentCloud API.

A work in progress.

## To-do list
- [ ] Align function names/functionality with [Python wrapper](https://documentcloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [ ] Add function for single document upload
- [ ] Better documentation of functions
- [ ] Formalize as R package
- [ ] Submit to CRAN
- [ ] Formal documentation

## Installation

You can install the development version of rdocumentcloud like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(rdocumentcloud)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.


## Functions

### Main functions

**Usage**
```R
#Function to do initial authentication with DocumentCloud API using username and password.
dc_auth('username@email.com', 'my_secret_password')

#Function to refresh authentication tokens.
dc_refresh_token(TKTK)

#Function to perform bulk upload of documents to DocumentCloud. Returns a dataframe
# of paths and destination urls. NOTE: must already be authenticated
upload_documents(file_names, 208620, unlist(auth_response$refresh))
```

### Utility functions

**Usage**
```R
# Utility function to allow vectorization of multiple requests in a main function.
bulk_put_request(TKTK)

# Utility function that accepts a dataframe and column to check for duplicates, and renames if a duplicate name is found.
dupe_check(TKTK)

#Utility function to test for valid filetypes
#https://www.documentcloud.org/help/tips#file-types-supported
check_filetype(TKTK)
```
